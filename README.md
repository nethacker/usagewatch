## DESCRIPTION:

A Ruby Class with methods to find usage statistics on a Linux server such as CPU, Disk, TCP/UDP Connections, Load, 
Bandwidth, Disk I/O, and Memory

## Getting Started

gem install usagewatch

```ruby
require 'usagewatch'

usw = Usagewatch

usw.uw_diskused
usw.uw_diskused_perc
usw.uw_cpuused
usw.uw_tcpused
usw.uw_udpused
usw.uw_memused
usw.uw_load
usw.uw_bandrx
usw.uw_bandtx
usw.uw_diskioreads
usw.uw_diskiowrites
usw.uw_cputop
usw.uw_memtop
```

## Example

```bash
Run:

linux_example.rb

Example Output:

11.56 Gigabytes Disk Used
7.0% Disk Used
0.25% CPU Used
30 TCP Connections Used
0 UDP Connections Used
43% Active Memory Used
0.01 Average System Load Of The Past Minute
0.008 Mbit/s Current Bandwidth Received
0.2 Mbit/s Current Bandwidth Transmitted
0/s Current Disk Reads Completed
2/s Current Disk Writes Completed
Top Ten Processes By CPU Consumption:
[["/usr/lib64/erlang/erts-5.8.5/bin/beam.smp", "5.2"], ["ruby", "4.1"], ["ps", "2.0"], ["abrt-dump-oops", "0.8"], ["aoe_ktio", "0.7"], ["aoe_tx", "0.4"], ["ata_sff", "0.2"], ["auditd", "0.1"], ["awk", "0.1"], ["-bash", "0.1"]]
Top Ten Processes By Memory Consumption:
[["unicorn", "4.8"], ["unicorn", "4.7"], ["unicorn", "4.6"], ["unicorn", "4.6"], ["unicorn", "4.5"], ["unicorn", "4.5"], ["unicorn", "4.3"], ["unicorn", "4.3"], ["unicorn", "4.2"], ["/usr/lib64/erlang/erts-5.8.5/bin/beam.smp", "4.0"]]
```

## Notes

Disk Used is a sum of all partitions calculated in Gigabytes

Disk Used Percentage is a total percentage of all disk partitions used

CPU Used is a percentage of current CPU being used

TCP/UDP Connections Used is a total count of each respectively

Active Memory Used is a percentage of active system memory being used

Load is the average load of the past minute

Bandwidth is current received and transmitted in Megabits

Disk IO is current disk reads and writes completed per second

Top Ten Processes By CPU Consumption are based on percent CPU used

Top Ten Processes By Memory Consumption are base on percent Memory used
